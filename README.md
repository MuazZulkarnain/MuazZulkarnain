Hi, I'm Muaz Zulkarnain! ðŸ˜„;

Growing up as the eldest out of eight siblings makes me always strive for the best and become an exemplary model for my cute brothers and sisters. I always have had a passion for trying and learning new things, which is why I joined and participated in any activities and events I can get my hands on;

I always try to push myself out of my comfort zone and had done some part-time work aside from my full-time study as a Computer-Electronic & IT Engineering student;

Currently seeking internship placement (July Intake);
