Hi, I'm Muaz Zulkarnain! ðŸ˜„

  I studied Computer-Electronics and Information Engineering Degree but I had a keen interest in becoming a professional full stack developer. I'm based in Malaysia.
  
  I'm currently learning both front-end UI/UX and backend developments. 
  Actively learning Flutter and Firebase. 
  Hope to learn a lot in rapid pace in near future.
